    <h3>About Us</h3>

Cruxly is a first of a kind service that can detect actionable intent in any communication, i.e., detect whether there is a question or request, or a commitment or promise in the body of a message or post.

The founders of Cruxly were determined to solve their own email overload problem – get to the 20% of emails that need an immediate response. Why can we not have an automated agent that can analyze the content of emails to determine what is truly important? They decided that the only way to find out such actionable messages is to actually analyze the content and grammar.

Cruxly was founded by a couple serial entrepreneurs in Boulder, Colorado in 2010. The team comprises passionate software and text mining experts with special interest in speech act detection.
